# Algorithm

This Algoritm is heapsort which is written in the programming languge of c++ and can be complied using any compiler when u complie the code there will be prompt to:-
Enter the array size and depending on that there will be array initalized
and then there will be asked to input the array elements so 
and afetr the array elements are instrted the heap sort function will be called and the array will be sorted aand then the sorted array will be output and then 
you can see the sorted array using heapsort
The sample run is given below:-


 clang++-7 -pthread -std=c++17 -o main main.cpp

 ./main


Size of the arrsy?:

4

Enter array:

34 52 634 463


Sorting...........................................

Sorted array is:

34 52 463 634
